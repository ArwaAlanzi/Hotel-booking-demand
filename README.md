# Hotel-booking-demand (EDA of hotels bookings)

Context of The Data Set:

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests?

This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
